# Words App

## Overview
A simple android app that that displays a list of words that starts with a letter chosen by the user. For convenience, the user can check the meaning of the word directly within the app.

## What I learnt
* Navigating between two activities using `Intent`
* Using Companion Object in a class.
* Using `RecyclerView` and `List Adapter` 
* Displaying Views based on a data model using a list of data class.

## Building the App
This project was built using gradle 8.1.* and JVM 11
